# Abstract

The standard hearing test evaluates the softest level of sound that a
person can hear across a range of frequencies that are important for
speech understanding. While this test is what determines a diagnosis of
hearing loss, many people with clinically normal hearing sensitivity
report difficulties hearing, especially in noisy places. One potential
explanation for these contradictory findings is that the hearing test is
unable to detect all types of inner ear pathologies. These disorders,
such as inner hair cell dysfunction or cochlear synaptopathy, impact the
neural coding of sound, but are not detectable by current clinical
hearing measures. As a result, they are considered sources of "hidden"
hearing loss. In this study, I investigate whether other measures can
serve as biomarkers of these hidden pathologies and whether those
biomarkers are able to distinguish ears with experimentally-induced
inner hair cell damage from those with cochlear synaptopathy. I assessed
four measures of auditory function in chinchillas before and after
exposure to either carboplatin which creates inner hair cell dysfunction
or exposure to noise which creates cochlear synaptopathy. These four
measures include to measures that should be unaffected by hidden hearing
loss--the standard hearing test (ABR) and a measure of outer hair cell
function (DPOAEs)--and two measures sensitive to neural integrity and
are the most likely to be changed as a result of these exposures--MEMR
and the EFR. Ultimately, this work is an important step toward a more
precise diagnosis of hearing impairments, which is greatly needed as
targeted pharmaceutical interventions for inner ear dysfunctions become
a reality.

# Introduction

In the audiology clinic, hearing is assessed by determining the softest
sound level that someone can hear across a range of frequencies
important for understanding speech. Thresholds at each frequency are
plotted for both ears, and this is called the audiogram. If thresholds
are less than 25 dB HL, the person is said to have normal hearing. If
thresholds are greater than 25 dB HL, they are considered to have
hearing loss. However, not all people with a normal audiogram will have
normal perception of sound in all situations. Approximately 12% of
individuals with normal hearing complain that they have trouble hearing
in noisy places [@tremblay_self-reported_2015], like in a crowded
restaurant.

One reason that some people may struggle to hear despite normal hearing
sensitivity is that some types of damage to the inner ear are not
detected by standard, clinical hearing tests. Two such “hidden”
pathologies are inner hair cell (IHC) damage and cochlear synaptopathy
(CS). These dysfunctions have bth been shown to masquerade as clinically
normal hearing despite potentially having detrimental effects on speech
perception. IHCs are responsible for transducing the mechanical and
fluid motion in the cochlea to the auditory nerve by releasing
neurotransmitters when stimulated. If inner hair cells in a given region
of the cochlea die completely, no signal would be sent to the auditory
nerve. But if only a few cells are lost or only some of the stereocilia
is damaged, the signal can be transmitted but with poorer fidelity.
Thus, detection of a simple sound may still be possible, but
discrimination and understanding of complex signals becomes more
difficult. In cases of cochlear synaptopathy, the IHCs are intact, but
the connections between the auditory nerve and the hair cell have been
disrupted (i.e., the synapse). So, as in cases of IHC damage, detection
of sounds may still be possible, but perception is altered.

Prior work has attempted to find biomarkers of CS since it is believed
to be prevalent in the normal hearing and aging populations. Most
metrics thought to detect CS reflect changes to the neural pathway, but
are potentially confounded by IHC dysfunction which similarly changes
these pathways. In animal models, it is easy to experimentally induce
these specific effects and see how they affect different diagnostic
measures. In chinchillas, a chemotheraputic drug called Carboplatin (CA)
selectively damages IHCs, but leaves other cochlear structures unharmed.
CS can also be induced by exposing animals to a moderately loud noise
which results in a temporary hearing threshold shift (TTS) that returns
to normal after a few days. Using these models, I aimed to identify
whether there are biomarkers of auditory function that are more
sensitive to these two pathologies than the traditional hearing test,
and if any of these biomarkers can differentiate between IHC damage and
CS.

# Aims and Hypotheses

I will use this dataset to answer the following questions:

1.  Are any of the biomarkers (ABR, EFR, MEMR, DPOAE) sensitive to inner
    hair cell damage or cochlear synaptopathy? i.e., are pre-exposure
    responses different from post-exposure responses?
    [Hypothesis:]{.underline} ABR and DPOAEs will not be different
    before and after exposure since they are primarily driven by outer
    hair cell function rather than inner hair cell function. EFR
    amplitudes and MEMR thresholds will both be significantly worse in
    the post-exposure condition compared to the pre-exposure condition.

2.  Does IHC damage affect the biomarkers differently than CS? i.e., are
    post-exposure responses for the two groups different across any of
    the individual biomarkers? [Hypothesis:]{.underline} While both CS
    and IHC dysfunction will both reduce EFR amplitudes, MEMR thresholds
    will be reduced more in the TTS group than the CA group.

3.  Can integration of results across biomarkers better differentiate
    the groups than a single biomarker alone? [Hypothesis:]{.underline}
    Integration across all biomarkers will differentiate between the CA
    and TTS exposure groups better than any individual metric.

# Methods

Chinchillas are a commonly used animal model of human hearing
[@trevino_chinchilla_2019]. 16 chinchillas were randomly assigned to one
of two exposure groups, maintaining an equal number of male and female
chinchillas in each group. One group was exposed to noise for 2 hours to
induce cochlear synaptopathy [@kujawa_adding_2009]. This group is
labeled TTS because the noise exposure causes a temporary threshold
shift (TTS) in hearing sensitivity that recovers after two weeks. The
other group was administered Carboplatin (CA) to induce mild (\~15%)
selective inner-hair-cell loss and significant stereocilia dysfunction
in the surviving inner hair cells [@lobarinas_insensitivity_2013]. All
data was collected at Purdue University as part of my thesis project.
Hearing was evaluated using 4 different biomarkers before exposure and 2
weeks after the exposure.

## Biomarkers

1.  Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) Thresholds: This is the gold
    standard for clinical assessment of hearing in subjects that cannot
    participate in a traditional behavioral hearing test. It is
    typically used to test hearing of infants, but is also regularly
    used for assessing the hearing of animal models. Short tone bursts
    are presented to one ear at a time at different frequencies. These
    signals, when audible, elicit a stereotypic electrical response
    which is measured from subdermal needle electrodes. Tones are played
    from 0 to 80 dB SPL. The lowest sound level which elicits a
    repeatable response is deemed to be the hearing threshold.
    Thresholds were measured at 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000 Hz.
2.  Envelope Following Response (EFR): The envelope following response
    is an electrophysiological response to a sustained stimulus. In this
    case, a 4000 Hz tone modulated by a rectangular pulse (at a rate of
    223 Hz with a 25% duty cycle) was presented to one ear at
    alternating polarities and the neural response was recorded. The
    positive and negative polarity trials were summed and averaged,
    which eliminates the response to the tonal carrier and shows the
    response to the envelope of the stimulus, which in this case was 223
    Hz. The time domain response was converted to the frequency domain
    via a discrete fourier transform. The energy at the fundamental
    frequency (223 Hz) and the next three harmonics (446, 669, 892 Hz)
    was summed and is called the EFR magnitude
    [@vasilkov_enhancing_2021].
3.  Middle Ear Muscle Reflex (MEMR) Threshold: A contraction of the
    middle ear muscle in response to a loud sound results in a change in
    absorbance that can be measured. A series of broadband noise that
    increased in level were played, and the noise level that resulted in
    a minimum change in absorbance of 0.1 was recorded as the threshold
    [@mepani_2020].
4.  Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAEs): DPOAEs are an
    acoustic signal that is emitted from the ear in response to two
    input tones. When the outer hair cells (OHCs) are functional, a high
    amplitude response is measured. Where there is OHC dysfunction,
    amplitudes drop. DPOAEs were measured from 500-16000 Hz and reported
    as the weighted average at 9 discrete half-octave frequency bands
    from 750-12000 Hz [@abdala_2018].

Prior studies of CS suggest that the MEMR and the EFR should be
sensitive to CS, but the ABR and DPOAEs should be unchanged. The EFR and
MEMR measurements require good function of the auditory nerve, so EFR
and MEMR are likely to be reduced in IHC damage and CS.

# Results

## Effect of Exposure

First, I investigated how each exposure type affected each biomarker.
Figure \ref{aim1-abr} shows how the auditory brainstem response
(ABR)were affected by the exposures. The ABR can be thought of as a
proxy for the hearing test as it reflects the softest level of sound
that generates a repeatable neural response. There was a significant
effect of status (i.e., pre vs post exposure; F = 14.194, df = 1, p =
0.0002) meaning that both groups had thresholds that were slightly worse
after exposure, but there was no effect of group (CA vs TTS; F = 0.307,
df = 1, p = 0.588), frequency (F = 1.864, df = 4, p = 0.121), or
Group:Status interaction (F = 1.836, df = 1, p = 0.178).

Figure \ref{aim1-dp} evaluated the effect on DPOAEs. Here, I found a
significant effect of frequency (F=56.756, df=8, p \< 2.2e-16)--there
are clear differences in amplitude across frequency with the
mid-frequencies consistently showing the largest amplitudes. I also
found a Group:Status interaction (F=16.360, df=1, p = 7.081e-5).
Following the CA exposure, we see a slight increase in DPOAEs, but we
see the opposite effect in the TTS group.

On average, we see that MEMR thresholds increase in the TTS group after
exposure (Figure \ref{aim1-memr}), but the responses are highly variable
with some animals showing an improvement in threshold after TTS
exposure. Likely because of this variability, I found no main effect of
group (F=0.315, df=2, p=0.584) or status (F=0.693, df=1, 0.4191). There
was also no significant interaction (F=0.698, df=1, p=0.4173) between
group and status.

Lastly, the EFR worsened significantly for both the CA and TTS groups
(Figure \ref{aim1-efr}). EFR magnitude was significantly lower after
exposure than before exposure (F=12.9075, df=1, p=0.00314). Though there
was an effect of status, there was no effect of group (F=0.2507, df=1,
p=0.62441 ) or an interaction (F=0.9355, df=1 p=0.35054). Both CA and
TTS appear to affect EFR magnitude the same way.

In summary, the EFR magnitude appears to be sensitive to both CA and TTS
and DPOAEs were effected in different ways across the groups. I did see
that both exposures changed hearing thresholds, which was unexpected
given that these exposures were believed to introduce "hidden" hearing
loss.

## Can CA and TTS be differentiated?

In the audiology clinic, we do not often have a baseline hearing test to
compare to. Most people do not get a hearing test until after they are
experiencing hearing problems. Thus, to maximize translation of these
biomarkers to the audiology clinic, we want to identify a metric that
will differentiate between the two pathologies, even if there is not a
baseline to compare to. Thus, for the following analyses, I filtered the
data to only the post-exposure time point to compare the two groups.

When comparing the post-exposure groups, we find that there is a
significant effect of group on ABR thresholds (Figure \ref{aim2-abr};
F=6.226, df=1, p=0.0149). There is no effect of group on DPOAE
amplitudes (\ref{aim2-dp}; F=0.8547, df=1, p=0.3568), despite the
Group:Status interaction seen in Figure \ref{aim1-dp}. It is likely that
these subtle changes relative to baseline are obscured when only looking
at the post-exposure data. Additionally, there was no effect of group on
MEMR thresholds (Figure \ref{aim2-memr}; F=0.0274, df=1, p=0.871) nor
EFR magnitude (Figure \ref{aim2-efr}; F=0.1086, df=1, p=0.747).

Though there are no significant findings for these other biomarkers, we
see some trends. MEMR thresholds are higher (worse) in the TTS group on
average, and EFR amplitudes are lower (worse) in the CA group than the
TTS group. Despite this, there is significant variability across the
groups. For example, two TTS animals show very low MEMR thresholds
despite the rest of the group showing higher MEMR thresholds.
Interestingly, the only biomarker that seemed to differentiate between
the groups was the ABR, which should have not been affected at all in
either of these exposure conditions. Although the post-exposure ABR
thresholds were still in the normal range for both groups, when closely
compared, we do find the ABR thresholds to consistently be slightly
better for the TTS group than the CA group.

## Biomarker Integration

The effects of IHC damage and CS are subtle and have similar effects on
the processing of auditory signals. In the final aim, I asked whether a
combination of metrics was better able to separate the CA and TTS
exposure groups. First, I split the data into a training set (75%) and a
test set (remaining 25% of the subjects). I created a 10-fold cross
validation set from the training data. Then I used a decision tree
classifier and the following model which incorporates values from each
of the metrics used in the study:

$$
Group \sim Sex + ABR_{500}  + ABR_{1000} + ABR_{2000} + ABR_{4000}  + ABR_{8000}    +
$$ $$
DP_{707}    + DP_{1000} +   DP_{1414}   + DP_{2000} +DP_{2828}+ DP_{4000}   +DP_{5656}  +DP_{8000}+ DP_{11313} +
$$ $$
MEMR_{threshold}    +   EFR_{amp}
$$ I then fit the re-sampled training data with the model. Ultimately,
the training data showed only \~50% accuracy--it labeled all animals as
being in the CA group. I then tried other techniques for classification
including a random forest, and SVM. No method improved the accuracy.

# Discussion

The results of this study provide valuable insight into diagnostics of
hearing loss. The results show that there are effects on our battery of
biomarkers in both exposure groups. TTS created a slight elevation in
thresholds, a slight decline in DPOAEs, and a decline in EFR magnitude.
CA similarly increased ABR thresholds and decreased EFR magnitude, but
the DPOAEs increased slightly, the opposite effect of TTS.

Despite these changes relative to baseline, the only signficant group
effect was on the ABR thresholds. With the other biomarkers, the groups
could not be differentiated from each other when only using the
post-exposure data, a condition more common to the audiology clinic
where baseline tests are not always available. Integration across all
biomarkers in a single model did not aid in classification. We see that
there is a large degree of individual variability in both exposure
groups, which potentially impacted our ability to classify the groups.
We should also look to see if some animals are outliers. Although all
animals underwent the same process for the exposure that they were
assigned to, we see differences in the effect and its possible that some
animals have cochlear pathologies beyond the ones we aimed to isolate in
this study, such as OHC dysfunction which has been shown to elevate
hearing thresholds and decrease DPOAE amplitudes. Given the variability
in effect of the exposure, a larger group of animals may be valuable for
future studies.

One surprising finding was the Group:Status interaction for DPOAEs found
in Aim 1 (see Figure \ref{aim1-dp} ). The CA group showing an increase
in DPOAE amplitude was unexpected. If DPOAEs measures OHC function, and
OHC function was unchanged, why do the amplitudes improve? We believe
this may have to do with a change in the efferent feedback to the
cochlea. With IHC dysfunction, the afferent input to the auditory nerve
is reduced, which in turn reduces how much efferent feedback there is to
the OHCs, potentially "unmasking" their activity.

Our inability to differentiate the CA-induced inner hair cell
dysfunction from TTS-induced cochlear synaptopathy has important
implications for hearing research broadly. Many papers over the last
decade have raced to find biomarkers of cochlear synaptopahty given its
potential implications for speech perception, but few have considered
that IHC dysfunction more broadly could mirror the effects of CS. We
find that the two groups are largely indistinguishable with these common
measures. Studies should be careful to consider the potential confound
of IHC dysfunction in studies of CS.

## Limitations

This work could be improved in two ways. First, future studies should
consider additional metrics that may help to classify these two types of
pathologies. There are many metrics than can be derived from each of the
biomarkers used here. For example, rather than looking at ABR
thresholds, one could look at changes in latency of the response or
amplitude of the neural response. Some studies have also suggested that
a ratio of the waves in the ABR could be an indicator of cochlear
synaptopathy. Inclusion of these metrics could prove informative where
the two groups could not previously be separated. Secondly, including
histological analyses of the cochleas would be valuable. In this
project, I have only grouped the animals by the exposure that they
received, but I have not yet confirmed that the exposure created exactly
the pathology we expect for each individual. Prior studies from our lab
have confirmed these exposure parameters and the type of dysfunction
that they induce, but this can vary across individuals. In this study we
are using exposure group as a proxy for the type of pathology the
animals have, but rather than predicting the exposure group that the
animal belongs to, we ultimately hope that we can use these biomarkers
to predict the degree of each specific dysfunction present. Precision
diagnostics for specific cochlear pathologies are necessary for identify
the appropriate candidates for pharmaceutical interventions which target
specific cochlear dysfunctions.
